                </div>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.125rem;">I would like to work for this company because I have always been impressed by its products. I have bad eczema on my face, and Rare Beauty is the only makeup brand I have used that hasn't triggered it. Rare Beauty also has very clean ingredients and is cruelty-free, which aligns with my values.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.125rem;">I am qualified for this job because I have been studying communication in media for three years, am interested in graphic design, have studied advertisement appeals, and public relations with consumers. I have been using Rare Beauty for around four years, with the company launching in 2020.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.125rem;">Rare Beauty is looking for someone who can work with Excel, has good communication skills, and can work with people from different backgrounds. These are all things I pride myself on knowing and being able to achieve. They also want someone who is passionate about not only the brand's vision, but their products as well, which I believe I am highly qualified for because of my deep appreciation for their products.</p>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; padding: 1rem; background: rgba(46, 125, 50, 0.05); border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid var(--primary);">

                    <p style="font-size: 1.125rem;">support@beingfrenshe.com</p>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.125rem;">I would like to work for this company because I not only like the owner, but I also like how fresh the products seem to be. All of the scents Frenshe releases have a very fragrant smell that I enjoy. A lot of perfume brands have gone too far with chemical-like scents, which makes me love Frenshe even more because of their light scents.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.125rem;">I am qualified for this position because I have had experience with being a brand associate at another company and know how to sell products and services to customers. I have also been using their products since their company was established, which was also in 2020.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.125rem;">Like Rare Beauty, they are looking for someone who is not only passionate about their products but is also able to work with people from different backgrounds, which I have done. The team is also looking for someone who can promote products on social media, which I can do because I have a good following and love the idea of advertising and design.</p>
